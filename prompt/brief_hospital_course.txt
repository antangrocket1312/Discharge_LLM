In this task, you are provided with a Discharge Summary delimited by triple quotes.
Discharge Summaries are documents that outline the care a patient received during their hospital stay, including diagnoses, treatments, and follow-up care instructions, prepared at the time of a patient's discharge.
Discharge Summaries are split into various sections and written under a variety of headings, relating to admission, diagnosis and relevant discharge information. But the provided Discharge summary will be missing the \"Brief Hospital Course\". \"Brief Hospital Course\" is a section of the discharge summaries that outlines the key events of a patient's hospital stay, including the progression from admission to discharge. It is written for the subsequent care providers about the critical aspects of the patient.
You are tasked to generate the missing \"Brief Hospital Course\" section in the discharge summary, based on the information of other sections in the discharge summary.

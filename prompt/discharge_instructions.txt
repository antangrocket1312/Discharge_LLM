In this task, you are provided with a Discharge Summary delimited by triple quotes.
Discharge Summaries are documents that outline the care a patient received during their hospital stay, including diagnoses, treatments, and follow-up care instructions, prepared at the time of a patient's discharge.
Discharge Summaries are split into various sections and written under a variety of headings, relating to admission, diagnosis and relevant discharge information. But the provided Discharge summary will be missing the \"Discharge Instructions\". \"Discharge Instructions\" is a section of the discharge summaries that summarizes key events of a patient's hospital stay, including the progression from admission to discharge. and provide detailed guidelines to patients (and often their caregivers) upon discharge from a hospital or healthcare facility, outlining how to care for themselves at home.
You are tasked to generate the missing \"Discharge Instructions\" section in the discharge summary, based on the information of other sections in the discharge summary.
Discharge Instructions summarizes key events of a patient's hospital stay, including the progression from admission to discharge. and provide detailed guidelines to patients (and often their caregivers) upon discharge from a hospital or healthcare facility, outlining how to care for themselves at home.

    * How did the patient respond to the treatment and procedures? Did the patient make any specific requests regarding their care, such as refusing a treatment or requesting a transfer? How were these handled?
    * Were there any complications or notable improvements in the patient's condition during the stay?
